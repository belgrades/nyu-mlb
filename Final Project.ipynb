    "# Scouting scale (assignment).\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this class, we've discussed frameworks which communicate value, and allow for comparison. We've discussed the shortcomings of the conventional 20-80 scouting scale. We've suggested solutions for grading metrics outside of baseball.\n",
    "\n",
    "Either suggest some improvements which would make the current 20-80 system more effective, or describe a new system for relaying scouting information which would be less problematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Suggestions to the system\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all the usage of the word effective is strange as the objective of the system is to measure future performance of players. The not signed players have no opportunity whatsoever to prove they're valuable or MLB did a mistake (most of the times) therefore is difficult to measure accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some suggestions to improve the system could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gathering measurable data and assinging values without subjective evaluation should be mandatory. Assinging values from 20 to 80 is just changing the measured space and applying a simple categorization of it. Furthermore, assuming it **must** have a gaussian distribution may be wrong in some cases. Even though we know that when the number of samples is sufficiently high then the empirical distribution will seem like a gaussian distribution we can (and we do) find different behaviours (like power laws, for example) that will not follow this gaussian prior judgement.\n",
    "1. About 1. even thought having \"objective\" tools to measure future performance sometimes is good to mantain the \"human\" part of scouting. Otherwise Jose Altuve would not be playing.\n",
    "1. I really like the idea of baseball IQ. Therefore adding tests of situations or making the player analyze videos and explain the situation and what he could do may be an idea to measure future development at least in this criteria. I know that most of the plays talent will pay off but in some cases seeing beyond can [flip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApoJk9X7Vto) you some games.\n",
    "1. Making \"scouting future world series\" or whatever name MLB could add to see performance on field to support statistical/measurable elements on 1.\n",
    "1. Past medical records and nutrition information is used in Venezuela. According to some scouts back in 2013 I heard that Salvador Perez wouldn't last that much as he had eating disorders as a child. Specially in Latam this is extremely common."

    "\n",
    "Understanding Run Expectancy and run estimators is a critical/fundamental aspect of sabermetrics. In the run environment which spanned 1993-2009, what was the expected run value of being on first base with no outs, versus the expected run value of being on second base with one out?\n",

    "1. Expected run value of being on second base with one out: **0.723**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This question may be related with the diminishing of bunts with man on first base with no outs. Moreover, if we analyze the probability (empirical chance) of scoring in the two states we found: **0.442** and **0.419**. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, further analysis could be added taking into account strikeout percentage of a batter compared to bunt success as chances of scoring halves if we pass from state man on first with 0 outs to man on first with 1 out. Also, we generalize against all possible runners maybe if a fast runner is on base and a high chance strikeout batter is on the plate may be logical to bunt.  "
